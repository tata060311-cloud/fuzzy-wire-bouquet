# Small Business Price List

A simple, user-friendly one-page site with a clear price list and a photo placeholder.

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Update the business name, phone number, and pricing details.
3. Replace the image placeholder when your photo is ready.

## Update the image

Place your photo file in the same folder as `index.html`, then update the file name if needed.

The page currently tries to load `FuzzyWireBouquet.jpg`. If it is missing, it will show `placeholder.svg` instead.

You can also replace the placeholder block in `index.html` inside the `.image-container`:

`<img src="your-image.jpg" alt="Business photo" />`

## Notes

- This project uses plain HTML and CSS—no build step required.
